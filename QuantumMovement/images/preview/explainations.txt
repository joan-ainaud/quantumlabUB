This text contains all the explanaitions for the examples given.


First of all a general explanation that corresponds to the tutorial:

In this program you will play around with a quantum simulation of a 2D schrodigner equation. You have two options:
Simulations corresponding to a single particle in 2D (x, y) or simulations corresponding to two different particles constrained in 1D,
where "the first one" is identified by x and the second one by y
